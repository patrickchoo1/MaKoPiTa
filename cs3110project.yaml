  Our project is an interactive rhythm game. With inspirations from successful 
  games like fruit ninja, the goal of the game is to cut through targets with 
  your mouse. Where the rhythm comes in is that you have to go through the 
  targets correctly along with the beat of the music. Our game keeps track of 
  points, health, and timing. There are currently two levels to our game that 
  increase in difficulty. Each level has its own song that the player must track the beats of.
